threads run the same time , (one can read in a file and one can write inside the file at the same time)
mutex sleep a thread in order to allow other threads to do its work.

pthread_join() wait for the thread to finsh and clean it eventually.

3 800 200 200 (3 is number of philo ) (800 time to die if no eat no sleep (time to fast)) , (200 time to eat) (200 time to sleep)

mutex used for threads, while semaphores used for processes.

mutex is forbiden in b part. (use semaphores instead with processes)

pthread_join can make it easy for you to get a returned value from the thread routine function; example

void *roll_dice()
{
    int value = (rand() % 10) + 1;
    int *result ;
    *result = value;
    printf("%d\n",*result);
    return ((void *)result);  <--- where we send the value to pthread_join;
}
    int *res;
    if(pthread_join(t1,(void**)&res) != 0) <--- here we assign the value returned to the variable we want.
